Zhang, Weiwei, Nilay Kumar, Jessica R. Helwig, Alexis Hoerter, Anjali S. Iyer-Pascuzzi, David M. Umulis, Elsje Pienaar, and Christopher J. Staiger. "Local traveling waves of cytosolic calcium elicited by defense signals or wounding are propagated by distinct mechanisms." bioRxiv (2025): 2025-01.(https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.23.634554)


**MATLAB code (three files)**: this code analyzes the peak features of calcium intensity traces (normalized as (F-F0)/F0)) using the MATLAB *findpeaks* function. 

**FIJI macro**: this code generates a series of concentric rings that scan a radial calcium wave and extracts mean fluorescence intensity profiles at each ring ROI in a time series.
