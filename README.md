Zhang, Weiwei, Nilay Kumar, Jessica R. Helwig, Alexis Hoerter, Anjali S. Iyer-Pascuzzi, David M. Umulis, Elsje Pienaar, and Christopher J. Staiger. "Local traveling waves of cytosolic Ca2+ elicited by defense signals or wounding are propagated by distinct mechanisms in Arabidopsis." Sci. Signal.18,eadw2270(2025).DOI:10.1126/scisignal.adw2270


**MATLAB code (three files)**: this code analyzes the peak features of calcium intensity traces (normalized as (F-F0)/F0)) using the MATLAB *findpeaks* function. 

**FIJI macro**: this code generates a series of concentric rings that scan a radial calcium wave and extracts mean fluorescence intensity profiles at each ring ROI in a time series.
