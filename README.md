This repository contains the calcium image analysis and mathematical simulation code for the manuscript: **Local traveling waves of cytosolic calcium elicited by defense signals or wounding are propagated by distinct mechanisms.** (link for the published manuscript: )


**MATLAB code (three files)**: this code analyzes the peak features of calcium intensity traces (normalized as (F-F0)/F0)) using the MATLAB *findpeaks* function. 

**FIJI macro**: this code generates a series of concentric rings that scan a radial calcium wave and extracts mean fluorescence intensity profiles at each ring ROI in a time series.
