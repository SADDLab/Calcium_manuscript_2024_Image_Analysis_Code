MATLAB code (three files) for analyzing calcium peak features in calcium intensity traces collected from Arabidopsis cotyledon epidermal cells treated with MAMPs/DAMPs.

FIJI macro for calcium wave speed analysis: this code generates a series of concentric rings that scan a radial calcium wave and extracts mean fluorescence intensity profiles at each ring ROI in a time series.
