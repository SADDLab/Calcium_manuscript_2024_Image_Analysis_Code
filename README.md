MATLAB code for analyzing calcium peak features in calcium intensity traces collected from Arabidopsis cotyledon epidermal cells treated with MAMPs/DAMPs.

Three code files are needed for the analysis: findpeaks3.m; CalPeakMetrics1.m; CalPeakMetrics2.m.

See the original publication (link:) for more details.
